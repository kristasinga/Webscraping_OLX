# Webscraping_OLX
Hello! This is a webscraping project to collect room rental information from OLX Indonesia.

In the developing world (particularly Indonesia), real estate data is very limited. Moreover, data in the informal real estate market such as informal room rental (in Bahasa, it is called "kost-an") is essentially non-existent. Informal room rental is a common mode of tenancy for the low and middle class worker, a segment often overlooked in urban housing policy. 
As internet usage is exponentially expanding in Indonesia, several websites emerge as real estate marketplaces for informal room rentals. Therefore, webscraping can be an alternative method to collect data and become a starting point in understanding the informal room rental market.
